# reCAPTCHA Breaker - Powered by Clarifai
Using Clarifai to 'break' Google reCAPTCHA

1. Open the reCAPTCHA box

2. Enter the 'prompt' of the reCAPTCHA. i.e: "Select all images with cars", you enter "car"

3. Press enter

4. Move your mouse over the reCAPTCHA box so that your mouse is on the top-left of the first image.

5. Press CTRL+SHIFT and wait

6. Automatic clicking may or may not be bugged, but the application will also output the 'correct' squares so that can be used to verify that the reCAPTCHA was 'broken'.
